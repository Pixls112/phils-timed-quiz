# Phil's Timed Quiz

## Description

This weeks challenge, I was tasked with creating a quiz application that would have a countdown timer, multiple questions, and would log the user's score/initials. I would use all the previous things I have learned and also additionally incorporate javascript into this application.
## Installation

To install my code you can use clone the repo using either the HTML or ssh key to add to your local machine.

## Usage

The main usage of this project was to show my ability to create something from the ground up given only a small amount of details to work off of and to try and showcase my ability and understanding of javascript. From what I have learned, Javascript is useful as it allows me cut down on the amount of text I would have placed onto my HTML and or CSS to mimmick the same action as it would have in javascript.
